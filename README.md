# MeterMaid

A cross-platform desktop **LUFS / loudness meter** built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app)
(Rust audio engine + web UI). It measures loudness to the **ITU-R BS.1770 / EBU R128**
standard and shows a real-time frequency spectrum — handy for normalizing the levels of
guitar amp/effects patches (e.g. Line 6 Helix) or any audio source.

## Readouts

- **Integrated** loudness (gated), LUFS — the overall "how loud is this patch" number
- **Short-term** (3 s) and **Momentary** (400 ms) loudness, LUFS
- **Loudness Range (LRA)**, LU
- **True Peak**, dBTP
- **Spectrum analyzer** — log-frequency, peak-hold, with dB and frequency grid
- **Target / apply** helper — set a target LUFS and it shows the gain to apply

The loudness math uses the [`ebur128`](https://crates.io/crates/ebur128) crate (a pure-Rust
implementation of BS.1770, the same algorithm behind ffmpeg's `ebur128` filter). Audio is
captured with [`cpal`](https://crates.io/crates/cpal) and the spectrum uses
[`rustfft`](https://crates.io/crates/rustfft).

## Audio source

The app meters any **input device** the OS exposes. To meter a hardware unit's USB output
(like a Helix), connect it over USB and select it in the device dropdown — its output
arrives at the computer as an input. To meter software/playback, route it through a virtual
device such as [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) and select that.

## Settings

MeterMaid remembers your setup between launches: the window size, position, and
monitor, plus the selected device, channels, sample rate, target LUFS, and clip
ceiling. Restored selections are re-validated against the hardware actually
present — if the saved device is gone it falls back to the system default with a
notice, and invalid channels or sample rates fall back gracefully. If the monitor
the window was last on has been disconnected, the window is recentered on an
available display rather than restored off-screen.

Enable **Auto-start** to begin capturing on launch whenever a valid saved device
and channels are restored.

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

On first launch macOS will prompt for **microphone access** (required to read any audio
input device). The usage string lives in `src-tauri/Info.plist`.

## Build

```sh
pnpm tauri build
```

The bundle is written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Code signing & notarization (macOS)

To distribute without Gatekeeper warnings you need an Apple Developer account ($99/yr) and a
"Developer ID Application" certificate. Tauri reads these from environment variables at build
time:

```sh
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"   # appleid.apple.com app-specific password
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"
pnpm tauri build
```

With those set, `tauri build` signs the app, submits it to Apple's notary service, and
staples the ticket. See the Tauri macOS signing docs for the hardened-runtime entitlements
(this app needs `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`).

## Platform support

MeterMaid is built on Tauri 2 and is developed primarily on **macOS**. Windows and Linux
should work but are less exercised.

On **Windows**, the Rust MSVC toolchain needs the Visual C++ linker (`link.exe`). Installing
the Visual Studio Build Tools installer is not enough on its own — you must select the C++
components. In the **Visual Studio Installer → Modify → Individual components**, install:

- **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ build tools** for your architecture
- **Windows 11 SDK** (or the Windows 10 SDK)

On **Windows on ARM (ARM64)** this is the usual cause of `error: linker 'link.exe' not found`:
the default x64 component does not include the ARM64 linker. Make sure you have:

- The **aarch64-pc-windows-msvc** Rust toolchain (`rustup default stable-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`;
  confirm `rustc -vV` reports `host: aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`)
- The **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64/ARM64EC build tools** component
- A build run from the **ARM64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**, whose environment
  puts the matching `link.exe` on `PATH`

Mixing an x64 Rust toolchain (running under emulation) with only the ARM64 toolset installed —
or vice versa — is the most common reason the linker isn't found; keep the Rust host triple and
the installed C++ toolset on the same architecture.

On **Linux**, the Tauri stack still depends on GTK3 / WebKitGTK. `cargo audit` therefore
reports several "unmaintained" advisories for transitive GTK3 (`gtk`, `gdk`, `atk`, …) and
`glib` crates, plus `unic-*` crates pulled in via Tauri's URL handling. These are not
exploitable vulnerabilities for this app and are tracked upstream by the Tauri project; they
are acknowledged in [`src-tauri/.cargo/audit.toml`](src-tauri/.cargo/audit.toml) and will
clear as Tauri migrates off GTK3.
